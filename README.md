## Drools Netbeans Plugin

A netbeans plugin to provide syntax highlighting and code completion support for drools files (extension .drl).

This plugin started as a fork of Benjamin Damer's drools netbeans plugin. It has been modified heavily to support code completion; however, much of the original code from the fork remains the same.
